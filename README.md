I chose a hybrid portfolio to showcase some personal projects I've worked on along with the professional tasks I have and hope to cwork on in the future.<br>
I chose to add an image of myself because it adds a personal feel to the site which makes people feel more familiar with the content and work.<br>

CSS :
Overall design : <br>
  I chose a minimalistic , modern design because it portrays my design style. <br>
  It gives a clean and organised feeling which is how I like my projects to be.<br>
Typography : <br>
  The fonts are both sans-serif for easy readability and it contributes to the clean aesthetic.<br>
Colours : <br>
  All the colours I used are calming while still creating a large enough contrast for accessibility. <br>
Layout : 
  The navigation bar was centered and changed into a horizontal list to make it easily locatable. <br>
