# HTML Assignment 
* Title : Shows the main purpose of the page - My portfolio <br>
* The Header : includes my page name as well as the naigation section.<br>
* Navigation secion : includes easy navigation to different sections of the page which shows information about myself and my work.<br>
* About me section : has a short introduction about myself as well as an embedded image of myself and an alt-description of the image for annyone who isn't able to load it or for screenreaders.<br>
* My products : with two sub-sections, each showcasing a project I've worked on with a short intro to what it is about.<br>
* Contact : has links to my email and phone for anyone that wans to get in touch.<br>
* Footer : includes secondary navigation links to different sections as well as my name <br>

I chose a hybrid portfolio to showcase some personal projects I've worked on along with the professional tasks I have and hope to cwork on in the future.<br>
I chose to add an image of myself because it adds a personal feel to the site which makes people feel more familiar with the content and work.<br>

# CSS Assignment 
## CSS : <br>
* Overall design : <br>
  I chose a minimalistic , modern design because it portrays my design style. <br>
  It gives a clean and organised feeling which is how I like my projects to be.<br>
* Typography : <br>
  The fonts are both serif and sans-serif for easy readability and it contributes to the clean aesthetic, it also separates the two from each other to avoid confusion.<br>
* Colours : <br>
  All the colours I used are calming while still creating a large enough contrast for accessibility. <br>
  The final shades of the colours have not been decided yet. <br>
* Layout : 
  The navigation bar was centered and changed into a horizontal list to make it easily locatable. <br>
* Validation :
  I used the W3C Validator and the first time no errors came up. <br>
  I realised I used the wrong one (HTML instead of CSS) and corrected the errors that came up. <br>
* Reflection :
  I experiences this section of the assignment to be slightly easier than the first because seeing the vision take shape guided me.

## Advanced CSS : <br>  
* Challenges / Ideas : <br>
  Nearly every part of this section challenged me :(. <br>
  I found it difficult to optimise the structure for mobile-first and it took me quite a few tries to do. <br>
* Decisions - Naviagtion , Structure : <br>
  With the minimalistic effect in mind I kept a lot of white space. <br>
  The buttons that change colour add a fine touch of interactivity. <br>
  Toggled navigation is easier to use on smaller screens so I added it for efficiency. <br>
  The image size reduces significantly on mobile/smaller screens. <br>
* Mobile-first / Responsiveness : <br>
  The trasition times are fast on elements. <br>
  I used fast-loading media and clean code to help the site load efficiently on mobile. <br>
  Transitions add to the feel of the sight. <br>
  
# Java Script Assignment
## JS: <br>
* Decision : <br>
  I chose a simple pop-up message that indicates which project the user is viewing. <br>
  It includes the title of the project with the message "You are viewing (project name)!" .<br>
  I also added a rotation on the navigation menu. <br>
* What user action triggers it : <br>
  When the user clicks on the "View Project" button the message appears.<br>
  The user opening the navigation menu triggers the rotation of the hamburger icon. <br>
* Why you chose that interaction : <br>
  It points out that the user is viewing the project they chose to click on. <br>
  It gives confirmation that the site recognises the users' action. <br>
* Any challenges or decisions you made while working with JavaScript : 
  Understanding the use of Java Script was confusing while only seeing the theory. <br>
  Once I started practicing and using it, seeing the effects myself it became easier to grasp. <br>
* Validation :
  When testing these additions in my console no errors turned up. <br>
